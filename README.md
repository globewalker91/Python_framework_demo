Python Framework Demo

This demo shows a collection of Checkio challenges, the solutions along with corresponding tests, and the test results.

Notes:

1. I have Python 3.8, pytest and pytest-html installed in my virtual environment. Use the uploaded requirements.txt to configure a virtual environment to recreate my test environment -- "pip install -r 'requirements.txt' ".
2. Problem solutions are written in Python 3.
3. Tests are run using pytest -v -s --html=./Results/Project1_rpt.html --self-contained-html .
4. The test report is in Results/Project1_rpt.html .
5. the report is currently formatted with some default css settings. You can get a better view of this here - https://globewalker91.github.io/Project1_rpt.html
